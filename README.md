# Teacher's day website
a small website made with next.js specially for teachers day!! if you're a student like me, feel free to contribute to the website (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`)

### How
In case this is your first time using next.js, don't worry! its not hard. check out docs at https://nextjs.org/docs. now here's a simple guide on how to start a local development server, which is bascially a live preview of whatever you're making. you'll need to have node/npm installed. (and git)

> if you somehow can't use it, (it has occured), you can use codespcaes instead, simply go to `<> code` and codespaces to open one.

1. clone the repo: basically you get it on your local machine one way or another

2. install packages: run `npm install` and you should see a new folder called `node_modules`

3. run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
