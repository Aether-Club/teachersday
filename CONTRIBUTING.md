# contribute!
hey, i heard that you want to help us in building this website! thats awesome! here are some stuff to know/keep in mind

### how can i start?
if you're not a part of the club, you can send your username to me (@candyisacat) and I will give you access to this repository! anyone is free to join! here are some things we're going to make (feel free to add to this list):

- a page for each teacher
- some art for each teacher
- cool stuff!
- poems... maybe in binary!
- (no actually but) gacha

### maybe don't do these
- vandalise/break stuff intentionally (its.. bad and i'll be sad)
- maybe not test in prod
- write bad stuff
- maybe minimize photos as its open source + on the web
